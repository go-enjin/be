# Enjin Golang Package

This package is the core of the Go-Enjin project and is named `be` mainly for
artistic purposes. It can be thought of as an acronym with the `b` meaning
"back" or "built" or whatever you like and the `e` meaning Enjin.

## What is Enjin?

Enjin (noun), meaning an engine for doing things.

In the context of the Go-Enjin project, this is an engine for making and
managing HTTP servers and microservices.

### Is it even a word?

No, the word `enjin` is not an actual word in any language, though it is an
homage to Heroku which is a really cool word which has it's own backstory and
is the hosting platform of choice for Go-Enjin projects at this time.

The word `enjin` is comprised of two main parts:

- `en`, this was chosen for "English language", or "English speaking" (this must
  not to be confused with any countries, nationalities or personalities in any
  way)
- `jin`, this was chosen for it's roots in Japanese such as:
  - `gaijin` (meaning "foreigner" - which this author is) or
  - `henjin` (meaning "strange person" - which this author also is)
